### Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it ###

This data visualization shows the performance of flights over the years 2000 to 2008. It describes the number of flights per year, month, day months, and day week. Moreover, it also contains information on United States cancellations and performance of carriers. Finally, users can interact on a map which shows the top 25 airports by number of flights. 

### Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback ###

**Bar Charts.-** I used bar charts because is one of the more familiar options as it is easy to understand and interpret. Also, I choose this kind of graph because is useful for displaying ordinal categories like years, months, days and it allow me to show comparions between those categories. 

**Pie Charts.-** I also used Pie charts because I was able to show nominal categories like Cancelled Status, or Carriers. This kind of chart let me show percentage or proportional data about some business characteristics. Finally, I choose this graphic because it is good for displaying data for around 6 categories or fewer. 

**Stacked Bar Graph.-** I chose to work with Stacked bars because it let me compare for each the different categories and which of those are the most representative.

**Map.-**  I worked with a map to show which is the airport who has the highest number of flights. Moreover, it allows to understand another things like which is the most visited city. As a result, using map let us to deepen the study.


### Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization ###

Even though get feedback from other Udacity's students was difficult, I asked for answers in my office. I have been working in Internal Revenue Services (IRS) from Ecuador for two years. The IRS have a lot of information so there are also a great number of data analysis. In summary what these people told me were:

#### Feedback 1 ####

**What do you notice in the visualization?**

The analysis performed does not specify data in detail. It shows the information in a general way, however it allows to have an idea about the flights in the United States during the years 2000 and 2008.

**What questions do you have about the data?**

There is information that was not filled during the years 2000 to 2003 related to the cancellation reasons of the flights. This allows us to observe that probably during those years there were not all the facilities to store this information. Additionally, during those years it was not important to know why flights were canceled. However, starting in 2003, this information begins to be filled, evidencing greater concern for the actors in this industry to better understand the business. In summary, information management improves.

**What relationships do you notice?**

The main relationship that can be observed in the data is the decrease in flights during 2002 as a result of the terrorist attacks carried out in 2001.

**What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?**

The main characteristics to change between the initial and final version were the colors of the graphics. In that sense it was very important to work on the styles to make the graphics aesthetically perfect.

**Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?**

Although the information in general provides a clear idea, it is important to work with data details because the information can be better understood.


####  Feedback 2 ####

**What do you notice in the visualization?**

From the visualization and the graphics I can see that there´s an interest on how was the performance of an airline, Every graphic tries to show a different parameter as:
 
1)     Numbers of flights, bars that show the size of the operation year after year.  I would like to have in the second axis the number of plains available, to have a full view.
2)     Status on flights, a graphic that shows how big could be the problem of delays, but accumulated, it didn’t allow the user to measure performance over the years.
3)     The third does what de second do not.
4)     The cause of cancellations is not clear, maybe a short explanations could help, and the same problem of delays over the years.
5)     5 and 6th graphics explain them very well, but we do not know what was the cause
6)     De 7th and 8th shows a lot.
7)     8 ok 9 doesn’t say anything because the number doesn’t change
8)     10 by day the number doesn’t change in the first days, but during the monthsmaybe it has a big difference.

**What questions do you have about the data?**

It is hard to say anything about the data.  Whatever source it has appears to be important for an airline to benchmark with others, and measure its performance.

**What relationships do you notice?**

Over the time the relationship could show tendency or problems.  It depends on the measure what we can see or analyze.  Although, to have many years could help making radical decisions on procedures, marketing, human resources, and many other aspects.

**What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?**

It could be a little bit simple, with no more than five measures, combining graphics, and parameters to move the graphic through the years or problems.  They should be used for taking decisions, so the takeaway depends on the necessity or the problem to solve

**Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?**

Although the information in general provides a clear idea, it is important to work with data details because the information can be better understood.

####  Feedback 3 #### 

**What do you notice in the visualization?**

The graphics show general information. However, some of the graphics are not easy to understand, such as: Flight cancellations by cause. There are three graphics with the same title but different information. 

**What questions do you have about the data?**
It seems between 2000 and 2003 there are no data about flights cancellations. This situation could lead to uninformed decisions. I wonder where is the information about delayed flights.

**What relationships do you notice?**
There might be relations between flight cancellations and carriers, but it is not showed. On the other hand, it was interesting to see  that flights there are not seasonals. 

**What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?**
Some conclusions are that between 2004 and 2008, the number of flights remain the same. That would be one interesting research. 
It is also important to know that the information about fligths cancellations is incomplete. So the Aviation authority must implement some measures about it.

**Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?**
I do not understand the cause's clasification. There are acronyms but with no explanation about what they mean. About the Top 25 airports graphic, I could not find 25 spots.

### Findings

* As the global economy is becoming more and more connected, the aviation industry is one of the fastest transportation sectors. Air transportation also plays an important role for tourism, also provides entrance to international markets and assists in the progress of world trade. During the last years, the industry has experienced a sustained growth in the number of flights, managing to overcome the terrible social and commercial impact as a result of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Impact can be observed in the reduction of the number of flights in 2002.


* Of the number of scheduled flights during the period between 2000 and 2008, it can be seen that only 2% were flights canceled, while 98% were carried out.

* It is important to mention that the relationship between canceled flights and flights carried out is maintained during all the years of the period. Concluding that the relationship between these percentages is normal for the industry because the cancellation causes are external to the operators.

* Regarding the causes of cancellation of flights, it is clear that 98% of the data does not have information. It means that around 66% of data has no value and 33% have a NA value. The other 2% is composed of: A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security.

* This lack of data that specify the causes of cancellation of flights occurred to a large extent in the years 2000 to 2003. This may mean that in these years this information was not relevant so the field possibly did not exist in the application through the which was this information managed.

* Between 2003 and 2008, the main cause of cancellation of flights is caused by the carriers (A). The next cause is because of the weather (B). The penultimate cause is the National Aviation System (C) and finally for security reasons.

* Of the 98% of flights that are not canceled, it can be evidenced that there are no seasonal sales. However there are high peaks in March, July and August. And a reduction of flights in February, September and November.

* Regarding the frequency of number of flights per day of the month, the days on which there are fewer flights are 29, 30 and 31. However, the frequency of flights on the 31st must be observed with care since it is necessary to consider that not all months have 31 days. From this point of view, the number of flights on day 31 can be considered high since only 7 months are counted.

* Regarding the frequency of flights with respect to the days of the week, there are fewer flights on weekends.

* Another important aspect regarding the flights carried out is the distribution by carrier during the analysis periods. A dominance in the market can be evidenced by Southwest Airlines Co, a company that during the analysis period shows a continuous growth starting from 22% of the market until reaching 36%. In the same way it can be seen that Delta Air Lines Inc. alternates the second place with America Airlines. However, at the end of the period it loses space and leaves the top 5. The other carriers that share positions 3, 4 and 5 also present important changes, as there are carriers that grow and appear in the top 5 while others disappear.
