#Summary - in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

This data visualization shows the performance of flights over the years 2000 to 2008. It describes the number of flights per year, month, day months, and day week. Moreover, it also contains information on United States cancellations and performance of carriers. Finally, users can interact on a map which shows the top 25 airports by number of flights. 

#Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

** Bar Charts.- I used bar charts because is one of the more familiar options as it is easy to understand and interpret. Also, I choose this kind of graph because is useful for displaying ordinal categories like years, months, days and it allow me to show comparions between those categories. 

** Pie Charts.- I also used Pie charts because I was able to show nominal categories like Cancelled Status, or Carriers. This kind of chart let me show percentage or proportional data about some business characteristics. Finally, I choose this graphic because it is good for displaying data for around 6 categories or fewer. 

** Stacked Bar Graph.- I chose to work with Stacked bars because it let me compare for each the different categories and which of those are the most representative.

** Map.-  I worked with a map to show which is the airport who has the highest number of flights. Moreover, it allows to understand another things like which is the most visited city. As a result, using map let us to deepen the study.


#Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

Even though get feedback from other Udacity's students was difficult, I asked for answers in my office. I have been working in Internal Revenue Services (IRS) from Ecuador for two years. The IRS have a lot of information so there are also a great number of data analysis. In summary what these people told me were:


What do you notice in the visualization?

The analysis performed does not specify data in detail. It shows the information in a general way, however it allows to have an idea about the flights in the United States during the years 2000 and 2008.

What questions do you have about the data?

There is information that was not filled during the years 2000 to 2003 related to the cancellation reasons of the flights. This allows us to observe that probably during those years there were not all the facilities to store this information. Additionally, during those years it was not important to know why flights were canceled. However, starting in 2003, this information begins to be filled, evidencing greater concern for the actors in this industry to better understand the business. In summary, information management improves.

What relationships do you notice?

The main relationship that can be observed in the data is the decrease in flights during 2002 as a result of the terrorist attacks carried out in 2001.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

The main characteristics to change between the initial and final version were the colors of the graphics. In that sense it was very important to work on the styles to make the graphics aesthetically perfect.

Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?

Although the information in general provides a clear idea, it is important to work with data details because the information can be better understood.
